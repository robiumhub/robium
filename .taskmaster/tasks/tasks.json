Fix the preview functionality:\n   - If the issue is with the event handler, correct the function implementation\n   - If a modal component isn't rendering properly, debug the modal implementation\n   - If API calls for template details are failing, fix the endpoint connection\n   - Ensure the preview displays all relevant template information (description, structure, example outputs)\n   - Make sure the preview is properly styled and responsive\n\n3. Enhance the preview experience:\n   - Ensure the preview clearly distinguishes itself from the template creation flow\n   - Add a clear way to close the preview and return to the templates list\n   - Consider adding a direct \"Use Template\" button within the preview for better UX\n\n4.
