  - Editor/IDE configuration for consistent developer experience (e.g., .vscode, .editorconfig).
  - Comprehensive documentation and onboarding guides.
- **Global Colcon Workspace and Unified Base Image**
  - All ROS algorithms/packages are maintained in a single global colcon workspace for integration testing and validation.
  - The Docker base image is built to support all packages in the global workspace, ensuring compatibility and reducing per-project build complexity.
  - Even if user projects require only a subset of packages, the base image and global workspace ensure all packages are always available and buildable.
- **ROS Algorithm Suite and Task Categories**
  - A curated suite of ROS algorithms/packages organized by meta-categories and task categories (e.g., actuator, camera, remote control, arm control, voice control, mapping, localization, planning, person tracking, person recognition, character animation, etc.).
  - Each category contains multiple solution alternatives (algorithms/packages), each with a clear task definition, input/output relations, and a list of ROS packages used.
  - All packages are hosted in a global catkin workspace for integration testing and validation.
  - When a user creates a project and selects tasks, only the required packages are copied to their workspace, ensuring minimal and relevant project environments.
  - Emphasizes modularity, clear task definitions, IO relations, and flexible solution selection for robotics development.
- **Containerized Project Environment with Persistent Workspace and Strict Isolation**
  - Each project runs in its own isolated Docker container, built FROM a custom base image with ROS 2 Humble pre-installed.
  - Each project has a dedicated workspace and source files stored persistently on the host filesystem, mounted into the container as a volume.
  - Projects are portable and can be cloned or run locally.
  - Comprehensive container management system with automated lifecycle and resource isolation.
  - Persistent storage enables versioning, backup, user access, and robust development workflows.
  - **Strict isolation:** Each project container is strictly isolated and cannot access the volumes, files, or data of any other project. This is enforced via Docker volume scoping, network isolation, and security policies.
  - **UI-Driven Configuration:** All project, container, and workspace configurations—including isolation, volumes, dependencies, and environment variables—are manageable and configurable from the Robium web UI.
- **Project Configuration Management**
  - Standardized configuration schema for project metadata, dependencies, and environment settings.
  - Automated Dockerfile and docker-compose generation from project configs.
- **Project Versioning and Sharing**
  - Built-in version control and project sharing (no real-time collaboration in MVP).
- **Execution and Debugging**
  - One-click execution launches all nodes, with per-node logs, live RViz, and rosbag playback.
- **User Authentication and Project Ownership**
  - Users can sign up and sign in to the platform.
  - Each user has their own list of projects, which are private by default.
  - Users can create as many projects as they want.
  - Admin users can see and manage all projects; regular users can only see and manage their own projects.
- **Minimal Backend**
  - Provides component metadata, rosbag hosting, LLM proxy, and WebSocket sync.
  - Centralized container and project management with comprehensive REST/WebSocket APIs.
- **Simulator Support**
  - Embedded Gazebo with predefined worlds; supports object spawning and sensor emulation via ROS interfaces.

# Technical Architecture

- **Development Environment**: Monorepo structure with Docker Compose for multi-service orchestration, TypeScript for frontend/backend, ESLint/Prettier, .env management, pre-commit hooks, CI, and editor config. All services and tooling are containerized for reproducibility and onboarding.
- **Global Colcon Workspace and Base Image**: All ROS packages are maintained in a single global colcon workspace. The Docker base image is built from this workspace and includes all packages, ensuring that every project container can support any combination of packages as needed. This approach guarantees compatibility, simplifies user project builds, and enables robust integration testing.
- **Component Registry and Algorithm Suite**: Central metadata store for ROS2 components and a curated suite of ROS algorithms/packages, organized by meta-categories and task categories. Each algorithm/package entry includes task definition, input/output relations, and a list of ROS packages used. All packages are maintained in a global catkin workspace for integration testing and validation. When a user creates a project and selects tasks, only the required packages are copied to their workspace for efficient, tailored project builds.
- **Frontend**: Web-based UI (React or similar) for project and task configuration, code inspection, parameter editing, and terminal output. Provides full UI for configuring project settings, container options, workspace volumes, dependencies, and environment variables. Includes user authentication (sign in/sign up), user-specific project lists, and admin dashboard for managing all projects.
- **Execution Environment**: Each project runs in its own Docker container, which is built FROM a custom base Docker image with ROS 2 Humble pre-installed. This base image is maintained by Robium and ensures all projects use a consistent, up-to-date ROS 2 environment. Each project container adds its own colcon workspace and dependencies on top of this base image. The project’s workspace and source files are stored persistently on the host filesystem and mounted into the container as a volume (e.g., /workspace), enabling versioning, backup, and direct user access. **Strict isolation is enforced:** Project containers cannot access the volumes, files, or data of any other project, using Docker volume scoping and network isolation.
- **Container Management System**: Automated creation, naming, and teardown of Docker containers for each user/project with unique naming conventions (robium*{user_id}*{project_id}). Includes resource limits, network isolation, and scheduled cleanup of idle containers.
- **Project Configuration System**: Standardized JSON/YAML schema for project metadata, ROS2 dependencies, environment variables, and simulation settings. Automated generation of Dockerfiles and docker-compose files from project configurations.
- **Simulator/Visualizer**: Embedded RViz and Gazebo with rosbag support.
- **Backend Services**: The MVP will include a minimal backend (Node.js or Python/FastAPI) for metadata APIs, user/project management, and WebSocket sync. This will evolve into a more comprehensive MCP (Mission Control Plane) server in the future. **Implements user authentication, project ownership, and role-based access control (admin vs. regular user).**
- **Data Models**: ROS2 component metadata, project definitions, user settings, version snapshots, container registry, and configuration schemas.
- **APIs/Integrations**: REST/GraphQL for metadata, WebSocket for live sync, LLM API proxy, Docker API for container management, container lifecycle APIs, project configuration APIs.
- **Infrastructure**: Local and cloud deployment, Docker-based isolation, persistent storage for projects and bags. The base Docker image is stored in a registry and updated as needed for new ROS 2 releases or global tools.
- **Security Framework**: Container security hardening with non-root users, least privilege capabilities, network isolation, resource limits, and automated vulnerability scanning. **Strict project isolation is enforced at the container and volume level to prevent cross-project access.**
