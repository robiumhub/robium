# Overview  
Following a comprehensive codebase audit of the Robium robotics platform, we identified 47+ implementation gaps including missing backend APIs, mock/simulated frontend functionality, and various bugs. This PRD outlines the work needed to transform the current partially-functional platform into a complete, production-ready robotics development environment.

The platform currently has working authentication, basic project creation, and database foundations, but lacks critical CRUD operations, real data integration, and advanced features needed for a complete user experience.

# Core Features  
**Project Management APIs**
- Complete CRUD operations (currently missing DELETE, clone, export, share)
- Essential for basic project lifecycle management
- Users currently cannot delete, duplicate, or share projects

**Real Data Integration**
- Replace mock/simulated data with actual backend calls
- Dashboard currently shows fake statistics for 2+ seconds
- Settings pages cannot persist user configuration

**Admin Operations**
- User and project management capabilities for administrators
- System monitoring and health checks
- Currently all admin actions are mocked

**Container Management**
- Real Docker integration instead of simulated delays
- Live log streaming and resource monitoring
- Essential for the robotics development workflow

# User Experience  
**Primary User Personas:**
- Robotics developers needing project management
- System administrators managing users and resources
- Team collaborators sharing projects

**Current Pain Points:**
- Cannot delete projects they no longer need
- Dashboard shows fake data, undermining trust
- Settings changes don't persist between sessions
- Admin panel is completely non-functional
- Container operations feel sluggish due to fake delays

**Target Experience:**
- Instant, reliable CRUD operations
- Real-time dashboard with actual metrics  
- Persistent settings and preferences
- Functional admin controls
- Responsive container management

# Technical Architecture  
**Backend APIs Missing:**
- `DELETE /projects/:id` - Project deletion with cleanup
- `POST /projects/:id/clone` - Project cloning functionality
- `GET /projects/:id/export` - Project export system
- `POST /projects/:id/share` - Project sharing capabilities
- `GET /dashboard/stats` - Real dashboard statistics
- `GET/PUT /projects/:id/settings` - Project settings persistence
- `POST /admin/users/:id/actions` - User management endpoints
- `POST /admin/projects/:id/actions` - Project administration
- `POST /containers/:id/actions` - Docker container integration

**Frontend Refactoring:**
- Remove setTimeout simulated delays in Dashboard.tsx:49
- Remove mock API calls in ProjectSettings.tsx:242,265
- Remove simulated operations in ExecutionEnvironment.tsx:265
- Fix unused imports causing linter warnings
- Fix React useEffect dependency issues

**Database Extensions:**
- Project settings schema and storage
- User activity logging for dashboard stats
- Container state tracking
- Admin audit trails

# Development Roadmap  

**Phase 1: Critical Blockers (Immediate)**
- Implement project deletion API and frontend integration
- Create dashboard statistics endpoint with real data
- Add project settings persistence (GET/PUT APIs)
- Remove all simulated delays and replace with real API calls
- Fix React linter warnings and dependency issues

**Phase 2: Core Admin Features** 
- Build admin user management APIs and interface
- Implement admin project management capabilities
- Add system monitoring and health endpoints
- Create audit logging for admin actions

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- Docker container integration with real APIs
- Live log streaming via WebSocket
- Project collaboration and sharing system
- Project versioning and organization tools
- Advanced UI components with syntax highlighting

**Phase 4: Polish & Production**
- Performance optimization and caching
- Comprehensive error handling
- Production monitoring and alerting
- Documentation and deployment guides

# Logical Dependency Chain

**Foundation First:**
1. Database schema updates for settings/stats storage
2. Project deletion API (most requested missing feature)
3. Dashboard stats API (visible improvement for users)
4. Settings persistence (immediate user value)

**Build Upon Foundation:**
5. Admin APIs (requires audit logging from #1)
6. Container management (requires real-time infrastructure)  
7. Collaboration features (requires solid project management base)
8. Advanced UI features (requires stable backend APIs)

**Critical Path:**
- Users cannot adopt platform without basic project management
- Admin functionality blocks multi-user deployments  
- Container integration essential for robotics workflows
- Everything else is enhancement once core works

# Risks and Mitigations  

**Technical Challenges:**
- Docker API integration complexity → Start with basic operations, expand gradually
- Real-time dashboard performance → Implement caching and optimize queries
- Database migration for existing projects → Design backward-compatible schema

**MVP Definition:**
- Focus on core project management first (delete, settings, real dashboard)
- Defer advanced features until basic operations are solid
- Prioritize visible user impact over internal architecture

**Resource Constraints:**
- Large number of issues identified → Strict prioritization by user impact
- Frontend/backend coordination → Parallel development where possible
- Testing overhead → Focus on critical path features first

# Appendix  

**Research Findings:**
- 8 critical blocking issues preventing user adoption
- 6 high-priority core features needed for completeness  
- 8 medium-priority enhancements for advanced workflows
- 4+ active bugs causing development friction

**Technical Specifications:**
- All APIs follow existing authentication/permission patterns
- Frontend uses Material-UI components consistently
- Database uses PostgreSQL with existing migration system
- Container integration via Docker API with proper error handling

**Quick Wins Identified:**
- Removing simulated delays provides immediate performance improvement
- Fixing linter warnings improves development experience
- Real dashboard data builds user confidence
- Project deletion enables basic workflow completion
